<p>
In Psychology 100B, we learn the foundations of psychology. Our course covers development throughout the life-span, theories of intelligence, motivation, emotions, personality, psychological disorders and therapy, and social psychology. All these things help us to understand human behaviours and are useful in many careers we may be interested in. It also makes for a facinating class!
