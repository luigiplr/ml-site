											<h3>PSYC 100 Online Forums Overview</h3>
											<p>
Eight percent of your grade in PSYC 100 is derived from your regular contributions to the Online Forums. This aspect of the course is designed with the following goals in mind:
</p><p><ul>
	<li>
• To keep you involved in the course outside of the classes and exams.
</li>
<li>
• To give you an incentive to read and think about the chapters prior to the class where we will discuss that chapter and to follow up on issues that we began to discuss in class.
</li>
<li>
• To learn from and respond to the ideas and reasoning of your classmates, as well as the instructor.
</li>
<li>
• To have the kind of ongoing dialogue about exciting ideas that should be part of the university experience.</li>
</ul></p><p>
Please note that you can submit a maximum of six of the eight scheduled forums, and only your best four forums will count. This means you do not have to do all eight forums – you only have to do four. If you do more than four, then only your best four will count. You are expected to complete the forums scheduled earlier in the term, and to use the
ones later in the term as “supplementary” ones, to be used if you wish to improve your mark or if you missed one earlier because of illness. In this sense the later forums ARE the “make-up” forums. You can submit up to six forums during the term, but only your best four will count towards your grade.
</p><p>The Online Forums are completed within Moodle.
Online Forum contributions are not expected to be long (200 – 1000 words). However attention to detail, quality thinking, and quality writing are all necessary if you hope to get full marks. You only need to do four forums to receive your maximum 8 points for forums. However, you may submit up to a maximum of six forums. If you submit more than four forums, only your best four will count. So if you do not do as well as you would like on your first forum, for instance, you can submit more than four and your lowest mark (maybe that first one when you were learning about the forums) will not count.

																<h3>Ch 13 Discussion Question: Passion vs reason: must we always fight?</h3>
															</header>
															<div class="image image-left">
															<img src="images/forum2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
															<p>It has been suggested that one of Freud’s greatest contributions was in trying to outline the consequences of people’s internal struggles between passion and reason.  Can you think of an instance where you (or someone you know or have detailed knowledge of) had a major anxiety-inducing episode around a specific conflict between a “passion” and some aspect of “reason”?  As usual, use pseudonyms for other people.  You could also choose a character from film or fiction for this question.</p>

																<h3>Ch 13 Discussion Question: Personality and getting rich</h3>
															</header>
															<div class="image image-left">
															<img src="images/forum1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
															<p>Which of the following aspects of personality do you think are generally most important in influencing a person’s success in business?  Their genetically derived personality traits, sense of personal control, or optimism?  If you think some other aspect of a person’s personality, other than the three aspects mentioned is more important, please say what is and why you think it is usually more a more important influence on business success.  Remember, this question asks about aspects of personality that influence business success, not other qualities such as intelligence, family wealth or background.</p>
