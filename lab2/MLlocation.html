<h1>Points of Interest</h1>
<div align="left"><p>
Ah yes. Some very interesting places indeed. Olive Olio's is a pretty cute little place with awesome entrees for when you get sick of caff food. Then, of course, there is the dog park. Don't even get me started on the dog park. If you ever miss your dog, GO THERE. If you ever feel sad, GO THERE. It's infinitely cheaper than therapy. Then go get coffee from Olive Olio's and your life will be complete.
