This is Kootenay. She is a 7 year old golden retriever. People in general tend to think that these dogs are friendly, intelligent, sociable... they have never met my dog. I mean, she does love people, but they don't usually love her back. Perhaps trusting a squeaky-voiced twelve-year-old with training wasn't the best idea; for all the effort I put in, she still makes  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FpcfrjkvR0" target="blank">Marley</a> look like an angel.

In the summer, I take Kootenay - and a pair of speakers - down to the boat launch and throw sticks off for her. (as seen in the first picture) Here is a snippet of one of the songs I would normally listen to. It just sort of fits the atmosphere.

This is a Vine I took of my dog last summer. She loves to play chase. Shortly after I took this, we hosted a barbecue, and my friend's eight-year-old sister Drew started playing with Kootenay while the rest of us prepared dinner. It was pretty funny to watch until Kootenay grabbed Drew's hat and ran around with it... and slobbered on it... and ripped a hole in it. Guess I should have taught her to "drop it."
